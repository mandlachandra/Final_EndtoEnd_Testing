#How did you achieve 65% regression reduction with your automation?

# I was working on the e-commerce platform for Michaels (a large North American arts & crafts retailer).
# They had a large regression suite that needed to be manually tested across multiple releases and environments —
# consuming 3–5 days per sprint.

# 🎯 Goal:
# Reduce manual regression time while improving coverage and reliability by
# implementing a scalable Selenium-PyTest automation framework.

# ✅ Steps Taken to Achieve 65% Regression Reduction
# 1. 🚀 Built a Modular Automation Framework
# Designed a Page Object Model (POM)-based Selenium framework using PyTest.
#
# Incorporated YAML-based config and parameterized tests to ensure maintainability.
#
# Used fixtures to standardize browser setup, teardown, and login flow.
#
# 2. 🔄 Automated Critical Regression Scenarios
# Automated high-priority flows:
#
# User login
#
# Product search
#
# Add to cart
#
# Checkout & payment
#
# Order history verification
#
# Covered positive, negative, and edge cases for better validation.
#
# 3. ⚙️ Integrated with CI/CD (Jenkins)
# Integrated the test suite with Jenkins pipelines so that tests run:
#
# On every commit (Smoke suite)
#
# On every nightly build (Regression suite)
#
# This helped us catch bugs early without manual intervention.

# 4. 💨 Enabled Parallel Execution
# Used pytest-xdist for running tests in parallel across multiple browsers.
#
# pytest -n 4 --html=report.html
# This reduced execution time from 3 hours to under 1 hour.

# 5. 📊 Added Reporting & Logging
# Added detailed HTML reports and Allure reports.

# Helped stakeholders and QA managers review test outcomes quickly without running tests locally.

# 6. 📈 Test Selection via Tags
# Used PyTest markers (@pytest.mark.smoke, @pytest.mark.regression) to split suites.
#
# Only relevant tests ran depending on the release type (hotfix, full release, etc.).

# 7. 👥 Cross-team Enablement
# Created detailed documentation and demo sessions to train manual QA team to trigger automation and interpret results.
#
# This made automation accessible beyond the automation team, especially during UAT phases.

# 📉 Outcome:
# Metric	Before Automation	After Automation
# Manual Regression Time	4 days per sprint	1.5 days per sprint
# Automated Regression Coverage	0%	~70%
# Bugs Caught Pre-UAT	Lower	Significantly increased
# Developer Confidence	Moderate	High due to instant feedback
#
# 📌 Result: 65% reduction in manual regression effort and improved overall release confidence.
